# TransactionsList

This is a small web app as a first project working with React.
The funcionality of this app is to store your transactions in the system devided into categories.

At this moment nothing is stored yet and it is just a practice project for React.

## Future

In the future I will extend this project with more functionality's and will integrate Supabase as a database to store the transactions.

## Demo
